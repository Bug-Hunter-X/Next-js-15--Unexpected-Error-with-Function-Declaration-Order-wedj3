# Next.js 15 Unexpected Function Declaration Error

This repository demonstrates an unexpected error encountered in Next.js 15 related to the order of function declarations within a component file.  The issue arises when a function is called *before* its declaration, even if it's declared later in the same file. This behavior differs from typical JavaScript behavior where functions are hoisted.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`.

You will observe that the application throws an error due to the function call before the declaration.

## Solution

The solution is to either:

* Declare the function *before* the component's return statement or 
* Rewrite the function using arrow functions.

The solution file `aboutSolution.js` demonstrates the corrected code.
